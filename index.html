                <p>
                    Saddle up for a musical journey through the Wild West! Trombone Trolley is an innovative VR 
                    experience where you hold a physical trombone prop and match the pitch of classic western tunes 
                    to power your desert cart down the railroad tracks. The better you play, the faster you go! 
                    Inspired by the rhythm game Trombone Champ, this immersive VR adventure combines hand tracking, 
                    physical props, and musical gameplay to create an unforgettable experience. Can you hit the 
                    right notes and reach the end of the line before the song runs out?

                        <p>
                            Put on your VR headset and grab the physical trombone prop. The game uses advanced hand 
                            tracking to detect your grip and movements, making the virtual trombone feel like a real 
                            instrument. Once you're holding the trombone, you'll find yourself on a cart in the middle 
                            of a vast desert landscape, ready to begin your musical journey.

                        <h3>Hand Tracking & Physical Trombone Integration</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest innovations was creating a rich physical trombone interaction system. 
                            We customized Unity's built-in hand tracking to accurately detect hand position and grip on 
                            the physical prop, mapping it to the virtual trombone in real-time. Players don't just move 
                            the slide—they actually blow into the trombone to produce sound, which our audio detection 
                            system analyzes for pitch accuracy. This dual-input system (sliding + blowing) creates an 
                            authentic trombone playing experience that feels natural and immersive.

                        <h3>Audio Detection & Beat Mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            The core gameplay mechanic relies on audio detection to evaluate player performance. When players 
                            blow into the trombone at the right moment with the slide in the correct position, the audio system 
                            detects their input and evaluates it against the beat map. The beat map system synchronizes the 
                            musical challenges with the cart's movement along the tracks, creating a rhythm-based progression 
                            system. This tight integration between audio input, slide positioning, visual feedback, and gameplay 
                            rewards allows players to feel the satisfaction of hitting the right notes and adjusting their 
                            technique on the fly.

                        <p>
                            A major innovation in our project was the custom shader work, particularly the note visualization 
                            system with beautiful rim lighting effects that guide players to the correct pitch positions. 
                            The shaders create an eye-catching visual language that makes the musical gameplay intuitive and 
                            satisfying. Additionally, we implemented procedural generation for the desert environment, creating 
                            varied and expansive landscapes that generate dynamically as the cart travels down the rails, 
                            ensuring each journey feels fresh while maintaining optimal performance.

                        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Creating a convincing physical trombone interaction proved to be one of our most significant 
                            challenges. We needed to combine sliding motion tracking with breath detection for an authentic 
                            playing experience. VR hand tracking systems are optimized for bare hands, so integrating a 
                            physical prop required careful customization of Unity's hand tracking to work reliably with our 
                            trombone design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Our Solution:</strong> We customized Unity's built-in hand tracking system specifically 
                            for our use case, creating a robust interaction model that accurately captures both the slide 
                            position and the player's blowing action. The audio detection system recognizes when players blow 
                            at the right moments, while our custom shaders provide clear visual feedback through rim-lit note 
                            indicators. This combination creates a rich, responsive instrument that feels authentic in the 
                            player's hands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another challenge was maintaining visual clarity and performance while the procedurally generated 
                            desert environment streamed in around the moving cart. Our shader optimizations and smart generation 
                            systems ensured smooth performance even with the complex rim lighting effects on the musical notes.

                        <p>
                            Trombone Trolley draws heavy inspiration from <em>Trombone Champ</em>, the viral rhythm game that 
                            brought trombone gameplay to mainstream audiences with its hilarious and challenging mechanics. We 
                            loved the core concept but wanted to explore how it could translate to VR with physical props and 
                            immersive environments. Games like <em>Beat Saber</em> and <em>Pistol Whip</em> demonstrated how 
                            rhythm-based VR experiences can be incredibly engaging, while titles like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> 
                            influenced our visual direction for the wild western aesthetic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also looked at real-world examples of musical instruments in VR, such as <em>SoundStage VR</em> 
                            and various virtual music creation tools. These experiences showed us the potential for expressive 
                            musical interaction in virtual space, but we wanted to focus on accessibility and immediate fun 
                            rather than simulation complexity.

                        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Physical Props + Breath Input = Maximum Immersion:</strong> The combination of holding 
                            a physical trombone and actually blowing into it significantly increased player immersion. The 
                            dual-input system made the experience feel remarkably authentic compared to controller-only 
                            prototypes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Visual Feedback Through Shaders Is Crucial:</strong> Our custom rim-lit shaders for the 
                            note indicators weren't just aesthetically pleasing—they became essential for gameplay clarity. 
                            The visual language helped players understand pitch targets instantly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Audio Detection Needs Careful Tuning:</strong> Detecting breath-based audio input required 
                            extensive calibration to work reliably across different players and blowing intensities. The beat 
                            map system needed to be forgiving enough for newcomers while still rewarding accurate timing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Procedural Generation Enables Scalability:</strong> Generating the desert environment 
                            procedurally allowed us to create seemingly endless tracks without manual content creation, while 
                            maintaining visual variety and performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Unity's Hand Tracking is Customizable:</strong> While Unity's built-in hand tracking worked 
                            well out of the box, customizing it for our specific trombone interaction unlocked much more reliable 
                            and natural-feeling controls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Playtesting Revealed Unexpected Joy:</strong> Even players who struggled with pitch matching 
                            enjoyed the experience, often laughing at their attempts and trying to improve. The game's forgiving 
                            nature made it accessible to non-musicians while still rewarding skilled play.
